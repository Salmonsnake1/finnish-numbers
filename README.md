# Finnish Number Practice

Small personal practice project that was designed for practicing Finnish numbers and their inflections. A number is randomly generated and the user can attempt to write the correct answer. The user can also 
toggle between numeric and word form. All cases singular and plural except instructive are available for practice. The maximum range is 0 - 1000000. 
The user can also practice ordinal numbers.

## Features
- Basic scoring and streak system
- Can switch between numeric and word - required answer switches as well.
- Customisable range
- Can switch between different cases except instructive.
- Can switch between basic numbers and ordinals - ensimmäinen/yhdes and toinen/kahdes. Either or are both accepted where both are possible. 

## Upcoming features
- : ending practice
- Finnish localisation
- Layout overhaul - will tidy up code at same time.
- 
## Known issues
- Layout issues - e.g. text version of numbers don't line up nicely.
- Custom Range is awkward to use
