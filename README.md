</p>

A personal web-based tool for practicing Finnish numbers and their inflections (0 - 1000000). Users can generate a random number and try to write the number down correctly in Finnish, in singular or plural, across all cases. Ordinal numbers are also supported and either yhdes or ensimmäinen, kahdes or toinen are accepted. Can toggle between writing down the number in digit or text form. 

## How to Play

1. Generate a random number.  
2. Type the number in text form (or digits if numeric mode is selected).  
3. Press Enter or click the Submit Answer button to check your response.  
4. Use the buttons to toggle between:
   - Numeric / Word form  
   - Singular / Plural  
   - Basic numbers / Ordinals  
5. Use the menus to select cases and number ranges.
